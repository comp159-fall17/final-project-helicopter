# On The Hunt
Final Project for Fly By Helicopter Games

## About
You are a "hunter" who has been tasked by an organization to investigate the source behind the strange occurrences that have been happening across the world. You stumble upon a phenomenon that traps you in a sort of "loop", and the only way to move on is for the you to eliminate the energy source that is trapping you here.

### How To Play
Use WASD and arrow keys to move, left click to aim and shoot. If you have a special weapon, you can use it with right click. If you have collected a shield, you can use it with spacebar. Once the game starts, you have the option to spend points, which are earned in the game, to buy upgrades. Once in the game, you advance to the next room by killing all the enemies. There is also a chance to get a free special item or to buy items using money from the in-game shop. At the end of the floor, you face a boss. Defeat it to go on to the next floor and continue until you beat the final boss.
